# Weather-Dashboard
For the weather dashboard the idea was to be able to input a city and get the current weather as well as a five day forecast
This project dealt with many calls to the open weather api.
It also dealth with creating some dynamic elements as well as hooking into existing ones.
This was a challenging porject because even though I felt like I was thorough with my Js file, it fell short in terms of functionality.
This project incorporated javascript jquery html and css. 
Although, this project isn't currently functional I will continue to debug until I can resovlve the issues
